# Quoridor Game

A fullstack implementation of the board game **Quoridor**, built to deepen knowledge and practice in both backend and frontend web development.

## Project Goals

This project was created as a learning tool to develop and demonstrate the following:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Emphasis on writing reliable unit tests before implementation.
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)**: Structured for scalable and testable builds.
- **Version Control with Git & GitHub**: Clean commit history and collaborative workflows.
- **Advanced Logic Programming**: Implementation of move validation, board state tracking, and pawn pathfinding.
- **State Management**: Managing complex, dynamic game state on the client and server.
- **Fullstack Development**: Building the game across the stack with custom APIs and client interaction.
- **Real-Time Features**: Real-time multiplayer using WebSockets and JWT-based authentication.

## Repository Structure

- `/client` – Frontend application (UI, state handling, event-driven gameplay)
- `/server` – Game logic, API routes, websocket integration
- `/__tests__` – Unit and integration tests for core mechanics
- `quoridor.js` – Main game logic module

## Status

Development is in progress. Core mechanics and tests are being actively built out and refined.
