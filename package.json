  "description": "Quoridor 3D Arena is a real-time, action-strategy reimagining of the classic Quoridor board game. Players control pawns on a 3D grid, dashing between cells and \"shooting\" walls to block or trap their opponent. The game is rendered in 3D using [three.js](https://threejs.org/), with fast-paced movement, wall placement, and tactical play.",
